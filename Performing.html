        <h3>Music</h3>
        <div class = "music">
         <div>
        <p>Schooling at GVN-The Global School goes beyond the classrooms and into the wider creative world outside.</p> 
        <p>Apart from a keen focus on academics, various creative activities are taught that engage the mental and</p> 
        <p>intellectual faculties of our students. Indian and Western Music, both instrumental and percussion</p> 
        <p>are offered to our students. Instrumental music strengthens their fingers and also improves</p> 
        <p>coordination of the mind and body. The life histories of famous musicians are discussed in the class</p> 
        <p>and the students gain inspiration and encouragement from biographies of these renowned personalities.</p> 
        <p>Festivals and presentations held from time to time in the school are occasions to showcase budding</p> 
        <p>talent in the school. The students also regularly take part in several inter-school events and have</p> 
        <p>done the school proud by winning many of such events. Undoubtedly, the pursuit of such creative</p> 
        <p>activities adds another meaningful dimension to school life.</p>

        <h3>Dance</h3>
        <div class = "dance">
        <div>
        <p>Dance is an ideal means of communication to express what is too deep, too fine for words.</p> 
        <p>GVN-The Global School, students learn to choreograph and are made conversant with various</p> 
        <p>Indian and Western dance forms like Indian Classical (Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Odissi), Jazz,</p> 
        <p>Hip Hop, Salsa and these are some of the most eagerly awaited moments for self-expression</p> 
        <p>and the students can be seen enjoying to the hilt. Lessons in Indian and Western music</p> 
        <p>generate rich cross cultural exposure and sensitize the students to this fine art.</p>

        <h3>Theatre</h3>
        <div class = "theatre">
            <div>
    
        <p>Shakespeare rightly said that the man who has no music in him is a pretty dismal specimen. Theatre is</p> 
        <p>celebrated as a distinguished art form in our school. Our strengths lie in a careful blend of</p> 
        <p>professional academic work and training . The theatre students benefit from the diverse experiences</p>
        <p> offered by an institution committed to providing exposure to various forms of expression.</p>
        <p>Theatre, at our school, presents a stimulating blend of cultural diversity, intellectual rigor and professional</p>
        <p>experience for the students. It is a stimulating place to learn and to grow, where the prevailing</p>
        <p>atmosphere is one of a family . The students participate in various theatrical expressions like</p>
        <p>monologue, extempore and role plays. All students are taught the importance of finer aspects and oratory skill:-</p>
        <p>the nuances, voice modulation, stress and Intonation etc. which make a world of difference to the spoken</p>
        <p>words . The Performing Arts imbues self confidence in children apart from manifestingtheir inherent talents</p>
        <p>and nurturing them. This self-expression through the Performing Arts defines our inner selves and projects</p>
        <p> it to others for all to appreciate and admire.</p>
