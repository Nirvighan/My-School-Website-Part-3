        <p>Classrooms are spacious, centrally air conditioned and have lighting arrangements as per international standards.</p> 
        <p>The number of students in each class is restricted, so that the teachers give individual attention to each student.</p> 
        <p>Aesthetically designed furniture has been provided in each classroom, keeping in mind the comfort of the child.</p> 
        <p>Each classroom of the Junior School has been tailor made to cater to the creative needs of the tiny tots.</p>
        <p>The Presiding members in the Goenkan Classroom are the Interactive white boards used in SCHOOL as a replacement for  </p> 
        <p>traditional white boards or flipcharts . They provide ways to show students everything which can be presented on a computer’s </p>
          <p>desktop (educational software, websites and others) in an actual working setting . In addition interactive whiteboards allow teachers to record their </p> 
          <p>instructions and post the material for review by students at a later time . This is a very effective instructional strategy for students who are absent from school, </p>
        <p>for students struggling while learning, and for reviewing work during examinations.</p>
    
        <p> 1. Creative video files teach a software application, a lesson, or as a review to be posted to the server on the web.</p>   
           
        <p> 2. Use the built in maps to teach continents, oceans, countries, or states and capitals.</p>   
           
        <p> 3. Showcase presentations created by student or teacher.</p>   
           
        <p> 4. Have students create e-folios including samples of their work and narration.
            Digital storytelling.</p>   
           
           
           
            <p> 5. Take notes directly into PowerPoint presentations.</p>    
            <p> 6. Reinforce skills using on-line interactive web–sites.</p> 
    
            <p> 7. Creating a project calendar.</p> 
    
            <p> 8. Illustrate and write a book. Use the record feature to narrate the text.</p> 
    
            <p> 9. Use the inter write software to create lessons in advance at home or at school. Then save them for future use or share with other teachers.</p> 
                
            <p> 10. Diagramming activities.</p>
